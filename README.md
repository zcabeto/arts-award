# arts-award
Unity game created as part of my Trinity College Arts Award. One of the first games I had written so far into development, back in 2017.

All of the files were added in the orientation and form in which they were saved when the game was created.
The Arts Award was at a Silver level done while at Secondary School. The Project was entitled "How to Make a Videogame" and included doing research about consumer markets and trends, then also beginning teaching lessons about coding to students of my primary school about GUI's in Javascript.
